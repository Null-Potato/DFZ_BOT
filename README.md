# DFZ_BOT
Discord-bot that handles lobbies on the DotaFromZero Discord-Channel

# Setup
I am assuming that you already have a Discord-bot on a server and are eagerly waiting to use your bot token with new code.
If you do not, then google one of the 1000+ introduction texts on Discord bots, read and execute it :-)

Then:
1. Install dependencies using 'npm install ...'.
2. Provide an .env file containing the fields shown in .env.example (use Discord's developer mode to get all the IDs)
3. Run the bot ('node index.js')

# Usage
Have one of the Coach or Beginner roles assigned to you.
Write !helpme in one of the channels the bot listens to. 
The bot will text you the commands available to your role.
